ArcGISSilverlightSDK
====================

ArcGIS Silverlight interactive samples that completes the official Interactive SDK by demonstrating how to customize or to develop specific aspects of the API.

For the moment, that concerns mainly:
•the styling of the ScaleLine control
•the styling of the Legend control
•the graphics rendering by using PieChart or ColumnChart
•the TimeSlider
•a few geometry utilities such as Linear Referencing or Geometric Projection working at client side
