This sample demonstrates how to customize the legend control in order to turn on/off the visibility of all sublayers when a parent is checked on/off. 

When a parent is checked on/off, there are 2 steps:
   - set recursively the visibility of sub layers (going down through the hierarchy of layer/sublayers)
   - set the status of the checkboxes (going up through the hierarchy of layer/sublayers). If a layer has some sublayers visible and some sublayers invisible, we use the checkbox third state.

To store the status of the checkboxes, we set the LayerItemViewModel.Tag property that is binded to the checkboxes in xaml.
