For this sample, the Legend Control is styled in order to use an Accordion.
That is done by modifying the Template Property and by replacing the default TreeView by an Accordion.

Note that to get this result without the TreeView, the Accordion items are binded to the Legend LayerItems that returns all top level layers whatever the LayerItemsMode.
Then the second level is an ItemsControl binded to LayerItemsSource with LayerItemsMode set to Flat so only the last level of LayerItems is returned.
