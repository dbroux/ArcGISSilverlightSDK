This sample demonstrates the Legend control. The Legend control displays the symbology of specified Layers with text explanations of what the symbols mean in a Map an organized in a tree view hierarchy. The specific Layers that are displayed in the Legend control are controlled by what is specified in the LayersIDs Property.

For this sample, the behavior of the Legend control is transformed into an interactive Table of Contents (TOC) where the user can turn on/off as well as adjust the opacity of the individual Layer’s symbology. Adjusting the Legend control’s behavior is done by modifying the MapLayerTemplate and LayerTemplate Properties with a user defined DataTemplate. Creating a custom DataTemplate provides powerful flexibility in ‘skinning’ the Legend control to meet various needs.

The swatches can be turned on/off just by changing the LegendItemTemplate.
