This sample demonstrates implementing a custom flare clusterer.
The custom clusterer subclasses GraphicsClusterer and overrides OnCreateGraphics that allows to set the symbols depending on the number of graphics in the cluster.
The sample shows how to make working the maptips when hovering the flare out symbols (by using the attached property Clusterer.ClusterChildElements).
