This sample demonstrates the default behavior of the Legend control.
The specific Layers that are displayed in the Legend control are controlled by what is specified in the LayersIDs Property.
By default only visible layers are displayed (controlled by the ShowOnlyVisibleLayers property) and only the last level of layers is displayed (controlled by LayerItemsMode).
Setting LayerItemMode to Tree results in displaying layers in an hierarchical tree.
