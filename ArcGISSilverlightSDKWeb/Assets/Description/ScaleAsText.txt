This sample shows how to create a control displaying the scale as text (something like 1cm = 10 km).
The input unit can be configured (cm, mm and in make most sense).
It would be possible to display such infos just by using Map.Scale but subclassing the ScaleLine control has 2 advantages:
  - the scale is calculated from the current extent (while Map.Scale is calculated at equator)
  - the output units changes depending on the scale (km/m or mi/ft).
